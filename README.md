# Hackathon2021

The inspiration for this project is in regards to the evolving gaming industry applying more ways players can interact with a game. Instead of just moving or clicking buttons, new games have begun to add voice-operated mechanics in order to immerse the player. As beginners, we wanted to challenge ourselves by creating a game that utilizes voice-operated systems in order to play the game.

This project is a game that asks the player several questions that are then answered by the player through a mic source. The program then takes in the audio that the user said and interprets it in order to play the game. In order to interpret what the player is saying, we created keywords or sounds that the program can use to recognize the playerâ€™s answers.
